Abstract

As e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows rapidly.
For a popular product, the number of reviews can be in hundreds or even thousands. This makes it difficult for a 
potential customer to read them to make an informed decision. This project is helps in getting the reviews about a
particular project using data from Twitter. For this the tweets about a particular product are collected and processed
in order to determine whether the tweet is in favour of the product or in oppose of the product  by using language 
processing. 
               The aim of this project is to make an application in the field of natural language processing in
order to find and implement an algorithm to solve the problem of measuring real-time comments made by user on products.
For this we have collected the reviews form twitter that is tweets by different users about a particular product and 
then the polarity of the tweet is determined that either it is negative, positive and neutral. For determining the 
polarity of the tweet the sentiment of each word of the tweet is calculated and scores are given to public opinions
of the products which could being used to compare between the products where a statistical output was produced to
show the results. The methods used in this project can be used for any specific product with public opinions.
